# advent-of-code-2020

Trying out this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge
with Clojure.

## Running

Make sure you have the prerequisites:

- JDK 8
- Clojure (see the [Getting Started](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started)
  guide to install the `clojure` command and toolchain)

To execute the solution for a given day:

- `clojure -X day1/run` (replace `day1` with the appropriate day)
